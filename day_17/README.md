What is Machine Learning?
=====================================

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that involves the use of algorithms and statistical models to enable machines to perform a specific task without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and relationships in the data to make decisions.

Types of machine Learning
==========================

Supervised machine Learning

--------------------------------
In supervised learning, the algorithm is trained on labeled data, where the correct output is already known.
The algorithm learns to map inputs to outputs based on the labeled data.
Examples of supervised learning include classification and regression.

Un-supervised learning

--------------------------------
In unsupervised learning, the algorithm is trained on unlabeled data, and it must find patterns or relationships in the data.
Examples of unsupervised learning include clustering and dimensionality reduction.

Semi-supervised Machine Learning
--------------------------------

In semi-supervised learning, the algorithm is trained on a combination of labeled and unlabeled data.
The algorithm uses the labeled data to learn the relationships between the inputs and outputs, and then uses theunlabeled data to refine its predictions.

Reinforcement Learning
------------------------

In reinforcement learning, the algorithm learns by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.
