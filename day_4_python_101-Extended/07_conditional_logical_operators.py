# logical operators
# Answer will be either true or false, yes or no, 0 or 1

# equal to                  ==
# not equal to              !=
# less than                 <
# greater than              >
# less than or equal to     <=
# greater than or equal to  >=

# Example
# print(4==4)
# print(4!=4)
# print(4>3)
# print(3<4)
# print(3>=6)
# print(5<=2)

# application of logical opeerators
# x_age=4
# age_at_school=5
# print(x_age==age_at_school)

# input function and logical operator
# age_at_school=5
# x_age = input("How old are you? ")
# print(x_age==age_at_school)

# age_at_school=5
# x_age=input("How old are you? ")
# print(type(x_age))
# print(x_age==age_at_school)

age_at_school=5
x_age = input("How old are you? ")   #input function
x_age = int(x_age)
print(type(x_age))
print(x_age==age_at_school)   #logical operator
